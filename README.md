# MakerDAO SuperDashboard
### by 44Finney team

We created a tool that helps Maker DAOâ€™s CDP owners analyze balances and performance of their collateral.

The following charts display:

- Collateralization rates of CDP over time taking into account the following events:
    - Adding collateral to CDP 
    - Wipe
    - Bite
- ETH price at which Bite event occurs, based on the following events:
    - Adding collateral to CDP 
    - Wipe
    - Bite
- Collateral amount and Debt amount over time
- Scattered collateralization

**MakerDAO SuperDashboard is distributed through IPFS**
